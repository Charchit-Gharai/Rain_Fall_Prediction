# Rain_Fall_Prediction
Project Overview:
This project aims to predict the rainfall in Kerala using various machine learning models. Kerala, being a state in India that is heavily reliant on agriculture, is significantly impacted by rainfall patterns. Accurate rainfall prediction is crucial for efficient water resource management, agricultural planning, and disaster preparedness.

Objectives:
Preprocess the rainfall dataset to make it suitable for machine learning models.
Explore various machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
Predict rainfall based on historical weather data and other relevant features.
